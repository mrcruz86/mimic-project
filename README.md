# The Mimic Project

This project is meant to help me learn frontend techniques by mimicing websites I like. The content and assets will be replaced with placeholders. I'm mainly focusing on layout, animations, and responsiveness. The goal is to get one out every month and to try and find a new feature each time.

## Current Mimics

... Coming soon!

## How to run

Make sure you have Node installed...

`git clone` this repo...

`cd` into the directory

```
node server.js
```

Then go to localhost:3000

This project is fairly simple right now. When it requires more complex libraries, the build process may become more complex.
